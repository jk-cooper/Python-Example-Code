# Python Examples

This repo includes a final lab from a Python course along with some other projects that I have worked on for personal development. Cooper_Lab10.py was an assignment from the Python course involving leveraging an Employee class with several attributes, creating a list of employees using input variables and finally printing the list to the screen.

randomquizgenerator.py is a program to build a state capitals quiz for a class of 35 students.  It writes a unique quiz file and a unique answer key file for each student. For each question there are 3 wrong answers chosen at random and one correct answer pulled from a dictionary of states and their capitals as keys and values.

phoneandemailregex.py finds any phone number or email contained in the clipboard and prints them to the screen.  It is a practice in the use of the regex package.
